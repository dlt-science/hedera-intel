# Hedera Transactions

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlt-science/hedera-intel.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repo

```bash
cd hedera-transactions
```

## Set up the repo

### Give execute permission to your script and then run `setup_repo.sh`

```bash
chmod +x setup_repo.sh
./setup_repo.sh
```

or follow the step-by-step instructions below between the two horizontal rules:

---

#### Create a python virtual environment

- iOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

- Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment

- iOS

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

- Windows (in Command Prompt, NOT Powershell)

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### Install the project in editable mode

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Run scripts

Fetch balances data for the first time:

```bash
python scripts/process/fetch-transactions.py
```

This only needs to be run once, and the data will be saved in [`data/`](data/) folder. run `git lfs pull` to get the data.

```bash
python scripts/process/process-tx-types.py
```

## Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)

All files in [`data/`](data/) are stored with `lfs`.

To initialize Git LFS:

```bash
git lfs install
```

```bash
git lfs track data/**/*
```

To pull data files, use

```bash
git lfs pull
```

## Synchronize with the repo

Always pull latest code first

```bash
git pull
```

Make changes locally, save. And then add, commit and push

```bash
git add [file-to-add]
git commit -m "update message"
git push
```

# Best practice

## Coding Style

We follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding format.
The most important rules above all:

1. Keep code lines length below 80 characters. Maximum 120. Long code lines are NOT readable.
1. We use snake_case to name function, variables. CamelCase for classes.
1. We make our code as DRY (Don't repeat yourself) as possible.
1. We give a description to classes, methods and functions.
1. Variables should be self explaining and just right long:
   - `implied_volatility` is preferred over `impl_v`
   - `implied_volatility` is preferred over `implied_volatility_from_broker_name`

## Do not

1. Do not place .py files at root level (besides setup.py)!
1. Do not upload big files > 100 MB.
1. Do not upload log files.
1. Do not declare constant variables in the MIDDLE of a function
